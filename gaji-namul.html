            <p>Gaji-Namul is a dish I usually prepair at the same time as my <a href="file:///home/tori/Odin_Project/repos/odin-recipes/silken-tofu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silken tofu</a> for an easy prepped pairing that stays good in the fridge for up to 4 days to add to rice whenevers. This spicy steamed asian eggplant garlic and sesame explosion is wonderful hot or cold.</p>
            <p>If you don't have a stove top steamer you can microwave your cuts of eggplant for 5-6 minutes for viable results.</p>           <!--unordered list of ingredients-->
